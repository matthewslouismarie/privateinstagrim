/*
 * The java code follows the Java Programming Style Guidelines 7.0 from 
 * Geotechnical Software Services available at this address:
 * http://geosoft.no/development/javastyle.html .
 * Some rules are still not applied yet.
 * However, some rules won't be followed:
 * 1. No underscore suffix at the end of private variables (r8)
 * 2. No space between a function and its parenthesis (r74). Instead, parenthesis
 * may be wrapped around space. So function ( parameter ) instead of 
 * function (parameter).
 * 4. Abbreviations and the use of init is okay (r17, r24)
 * 5. Statements and variable declarations don't need to be aligned (r77, r78)
 * 6. Class names don't have to be nouns (would make some class' names long and
 * poorly representative for servlets and filters).
